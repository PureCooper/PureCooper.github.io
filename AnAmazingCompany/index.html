          Andy's Frozen Custard has always been fanatical about custard, and has served it with pride since March 19, 1986. For more than 35 years, only the freshest ingredients have been used for a frozen custard experience you can’t get anywhere else.
          The Andy’s Frozen Custard tradition started in Osage Beach, Missouri when John and Carol Kuntz embarked on a new frozen custard endeavor. Their treat quickly became a legend at the lake, and soon took nearby Springfield, Missouri by storm.
          It was at the original Springfield location where John and Carol’s son Andy (and his wife Dana) worked long hours learning the business from the ground up. Their fanaticism for a supreme product and unmatched customer  service never wavered. Always striving to expand and improve Andy’s Frozen Custard, they have taken the brand to new heights, with locations throughout Missouri, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. These shops offer customers near and far, from the original Osage Beach roots, a slice of hometown Americana, where it’s fun to be a kid for a while. At the heart of each Andy’s is a fun work environment, where everyone shares in the fanaticism that brought Andy’s to life, and keeps it going strong. A unique but simple approach has been used to achieve such great success; hire great people, and treat them right. John and Carol's philosophy was always, "If you are in the service business, you have to hire people that have a strong desire to serve. Pay them above average, train them well, and demand nothing but the best." John, Carol, Andy, and Dana have been able to make Andy's Frozen Custard the largest dessert-only franchise in the world! Andy's can now be found in 14 states, and has more than 100 locations open, with several more under construction.

        <h1 style="text-align:right;">What is Frozen Custard?</h1>

        <p>
          No one knows for sure the exact time or place Americans first tasted frozen custard. Like many great inventions, this gourmet treat grew in popularity, and is now enjoyed by people of all ages around the country. Some sources trace the custard’s beginnings to Coney Island, New York, in the early 20th century. Perhaps first sold as a carnival treat, frozen custard could be found in resort communities along the east coast of the United States. By the 1930s, people in the Midwest were discovering frozen custard. After commercial freezers became more widely available, families started custard stands that turned into local landmarks. Many bear the original family name. The Kirkhoff family of Lafayette, Indiana, opened its first stand in 1932. The store is still in operation, making it the oldest continuously-operating custard stand. Currently Milwaukee, Wisconsin sells more frozen custard than anywhere else, earning it the title of “Frozen Custard Capital of the World.” Frozen custard machines have been updated throughout the years, but the basic ingredient list for custard remains short and sweet: cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and a few other trade secrets. Creamier than regular ice cream, frozen custard contains more butterfat, and is churned very slowly. The slower-turning blades keep air from being mixed into the custard as it freezes. The result is a dessert that is rich, thick, and decadent. Frozen custard is rarely packaged for store shelves, but instead made fresh hourly, and served immediately to maintain its luxurious creaminess.
