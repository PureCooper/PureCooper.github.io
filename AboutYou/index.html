      My name is Cooper Brown and I am 19 years old. I grew up in Branson MO
      with two older brothers, one of which is 5 years older than me, and the
      other being 8 years older than me. I have only lived in Springfield for
      about 7 months so it is a new place for me. With that being said I love it
      so far. I am a computer science major, and have always had an interest in
      computer science for as long as I can remember. I did a year at Missouri S&T
      but quickly found out that Rolla is a cesspit and is not a great place to be.
      That leads to today where this is my second semester at OTC and I am loving it.
      I also have a 6 month old cat named kevin who is in all honesty smarter than I am
      (see photo).
