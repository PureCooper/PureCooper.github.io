    <p>
      Programming is one of my biggest hobbies but aside from that I enjoy doing <a href="film.html"> film photography</a>,
      as well as collecting vinyl. Most importantly however, is video games as they eat up a large
      majority of my freetime. I primarily play single player games like Stardew Valley, Witcher, and minecraft,
      as well as the occasional League of Legends match with my friends. Additionally, on mondays I play Dungeons & Dragons which I enjoy a lot.
