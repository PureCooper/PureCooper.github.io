      <h1>Vitia</h1>
      <p>
        An untold time ago, the 6 gods, not much different in characteristics from a modern group of adventurers, were traveling the realms, learning of the many different worlds and planes they were born into. Life is at its infancy, and ideas are new. Thought itself is an unexplored idea. Lyssa, the fair and righteous, Balthazar, the mighty and powerful, Xolmir, the quiet, methodical, and cold, Theslena, the peaceful and all-encompassing, Ezrus, the chaotic and outspoken, and Vazra, the one who appreciates of the underappreciated, were these 6 powerful beings, bewildered by their findings. But no plane took their interest as much as the world known as Vitia. At first, a plane of chaos, dangers, and natureâ€™s wrath, the gods were surprised to find that life - human life - existed in this world. Against all odds, races of all shapes, sizes, and creeds were banded together with one unified purpose; survival.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Of all the realms, the gods had seen nothing like it, and had decided to help the races in their endeavors. They calmed the waves, wethered the mountains, slowed the winds, and banished the horrors. After some time of doing this, the gods had more worlds to explore, and thus left the races to their new home, but were still scared of the troubles that were left unchecked. So they left 6 giants to guard these races, the guardians of Vitia. In confidence, the giants had an immortal task. But the gods, in the most unlikely of events, made an oversight. The giants were only mortal.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Over the coming years, the giants went crazy with power, realizing that there was next to nothing that could topple them from the skies, and controlled humanity with an iron fist, treating the ones they were tasked to protect as if they were no more than mere slaves.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When the gods returned, they had become outraged to find that such a simple task had failed so miserably. The gods waged punishment on the giants, imprisoning them in the very world they once held prisoner, and leaving the races to their own devices and magics. The giants did not go down without leaving their mark, however, and cursed the areas of the world in which they are imprisoned, guaranteeing them a sliver of control in the most dangerous areas of Vitia.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As time passed, the reality of the giants was still everpresent, but the fear was no longer in question. Races marched on, creating farms, townships, cities, and empires. However, with the threat of the giants and the world itself no longer present, the races began to hunger for more. What if they were in charge? Who decides the leaders? What purpose unified any single person to another?
        Thus countries were formed, war was waged, histories were lost, and the world was now separated.
